            <h2>Problem / Data Domain</h2>
            <h3>Overview of the General Topic</h3>
            <p>
                Group travel involves coordinating and managing shared expenses for accommodation, transportation, meals, and activities among multiple people. 
                Splitting these costs can become confusing and time-consuming, especially when expenses are incurred by different individuals at different times and involve unequal contributions 
                (e.g., one person orders an expensive steak while another orders a salad). 
                Ensuring a fair and transparent distribution of costs is essential to avoid disputes and maintain harmony within the group.

            <h3>Information Technology Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Current platforms like <a href="https://spliito.com/" target="_blank">Spliito</a> offer solutions for splitting expenses but often fall short in handling non-even splits and providing clear categorizations. 
                Additionally, many existing apps use confusing terminology, making it difficult for users to navigate and manage their expenses effectively. 
                A more user-friendly and intuitive solution is needed to simplify the process, ensure transparency, and enhance the overall travel experience by providing clear categorization, fair cost splitting, and comprehensive reporting.

            <h3>Existing Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                An existing attempt to address this problem is the website <a href="https://spliito.com/" target="_blank">Spliito</a>. 
                While Spliito offers a platform for splitting expenses, it often falls short in handling non-even splits and providing clear categorizations. 
                The wording and interface can also be confusing for users, highlighting the need for a more user-friendly and intuitive solution.

            <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
            <p>
                By developing an app that focuses on clear categorization, fair cost splitting, and intuitive user experience, we aim to simplify the process of managing group travel expenses. 
                This solution will ensure transparency, reduce potential conflicts, and enhance the overall travel experience for users.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Type of Information Used</h3>
            <p>
                Users will be able to view information about their individual trip expense including, but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>name of the expense</li>
                <li>date of expense made</li>
                <li>total cost and its currency</li>
                <li>the person who has made the expense</li>
                <li>people involved in splitting the expense</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Most importantly, users will see how much each person owes each other after all the expenses have been added. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For tracking expenses made in foreign currencies and conversion, we plan to retrieve currency data from <a href='https://github.com/hakanensari/frankfurter' target='_blank'>frankfurter API</a>, which references exchange rates published by the European Central Bank.

            <h3>Why our project matters</h3>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the app solves the challenge of keeping track of expenses for travelers in a group especially when visiting different countries. By keeping it simple, it will meet the travelers' goal of enjoying their time with their friends and family over fighting for the bill.
