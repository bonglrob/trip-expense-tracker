    <h1>Group Travel Expense Management Proposal</h1>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Overview of the General Topic</h2>
        <p>
            Group travel involves coordinating and managing shared expenses for accommodation, transportation, meals, and activities among multiple people. 
            Splitting these costs can become confusing and time-consuming, especially when expenses are incurred by different individuals at different times and involve unequal contributions 
            (e.g., one person orders an expensive steak while another orders a salad). 
            Ensuring a fair and transparent distribution of costs is essential to avoid disputes and maintain harmony within the group.

        <h2>Information Technology Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Current platforms like <a href="https://spliito.com/" target="_blank">Spliito</a> offer solutions for splitting expenses but often fall short in handling non-even splits and providing clear categorizations. 
            Additionally, many existing apps use confusing terminology, making it difficult for users to navigate and manage their expenses effectively. 
            A more user-friendly and intuitive solution is needed to simplify the process, ensure transparency, and enhance the overall travel experience by providing clear categorization, fair cost splitting, and comprehensive reporting.

        <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            An existing attempt to address this problem is the website <a href="https://spliito.com/" target="_blank">Spliito</a>. 
            While Spliito offers a platform for splitting expenses, it often falls short in handling non-even splits and providing clear categorizations. 
            The wording and interface can also be confusing for users, highlighting the need for a more user-friendly and intuitive solution.

        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>
            By developing an app that focuses on clear categorization, fair cost splitting, and intuitive user experience, we aim to simplify the process of managing group travel expenses. 
            This solution will ensure transparency, reduce potential conflicts, and enhance the overall travel experience for users.
